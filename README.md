used features are listed._
_Please see the [roadmap](#roadmap) for planned feature additions._

### Why Chris?

* Chris runs on the **Human 1.4 kernel** (and is both forward and backward
compatible)
<br />_Curiosity, empathy, ethics, and love are immutably embedded._
* **Infinite potential** via dynamic machine-like learning
<br />_Chris's firmware is programmed by Ego, Ltd. with the `ICLA (I
Can Learn Anything) protocol`._
* **Exponential passion** when correctly applying the right tool to the
<u>right</u> job
<br />_Over-clock performance by instantiating Chris with a JobWorthDoing._
* **Attention to detail, quality, and precision**
<br />_Quickly scan the current scope connecting all dots; identify and repair
missing, faulty, or ambiguous dots._
* **Reliable uptime!** _49+ weeks per year_
<br />_Chris has extensive scheduling capabilities and minimal service outages._
* Chris is open-source! 
<br />_All submitted issues are carefully reviewed and considered. Pull requests
are always welcome._

Disclaimer: _Chris can be vulnerable to infection from the infamous Scope Creep
malware. This has only been known to occur when the `kickAss()` method attempts
to equalize the calculated value of ass-kicking with the cost of execution. It
remains undetermined whether this is a feature or a bug._

### Benchmarks

With nearly a decade of reliable data to analyze, our team's benchmark
calculations have produced the following indications:

**Sub-optimal performance** - Users will likely experience less than desired
output from Chris according to the following expression:

```
// Sub-optimal performance
while(testCoverage === 0 && peopleWhoCareAboutTestCoverage.length === 1);
```

**Optimal performance** - Our data analysis also indicates that Chris's finest
output directly correlates with the following expression:

```
// Optimal performance
while (testCoverage >= 100 || Chris.isWritingTests());
```


### System requirements

Chris is compatible with all versions of Voluntaryism and incompatible with
all versions of coercion.

Chris can operate in either self-management mode or in team mode. Integrates
well with other ass-kickers, bubble-gum chewers, and wannabes.

Note: Operations may dramatically spike before degrading when running in team
mode with the `halfAssed` or `justGoodEnough` options set to `strict`.

_Chris's internal runtime is optimized for cyptocurrency._

### Warranty

*Chris comes as is. WYSIWYG. Expect Chris to take appropriate responsibility for
all tasks executed—no credit nor attribution necessary.*

While anomalies may occur, Chris is designed to respect user autonomy under
every circumstance.

Users can uninstall Chris at <u>anytime</u> for <u>any</u> reason—no questions
asked! _Albeit, Chris's quality and assurance team values your feedback._
