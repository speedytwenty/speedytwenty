### Benchmarks

With nearly a decade of reliable data to compile, our team's benchmark
calculations have produced the following indications:

**Sub-optimal performance** - Users will likely experience less than desired
output from Chris according to the following expression:

```
// Sub-optimal performance
while(testCoverage === 0 && peopleWhoCareAboutTestCoverage.length === 1);
```

**Optimal performance** - Our data indicates that Chris's finest output
directly correlates with the following expression:

```
// Optimal performance
while (testCoverage >= 100);
```

### Installation

Easy installation! Contract, or contract-to-hire preferred.

_Chris's internal runtime is optimized for cyptocurrency._

#### System requirements

Chris can operate in either self-management mode or in team mode. Integrates
well with other ass-kickers, bubble-gum chewers, and wannabes.

Note: Operations are likely to degrade when running in team mode with the
`halfAssed` or `justGoodEnough` options set to `strict`.

### Warranty

*Chris comes as is. WYSIWYG. Expect Chris to take appropriate-responsibility for
all tasks executed—no credit necessary.*

While there will somtimes be anomolous bugs, Chris is designed to respect both
user and end-user autonomy under every circumstance.

_Users can uninstall Chris at <u>anytime</u> for <u>any</u> reason—no questions asked!
Albeit, Chris's quality and assurance team values your feedback._

Future versions will be licensed via the IT2D (Important Things 2 Do)
